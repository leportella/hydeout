**Abstract**: 
This study presents a sequence of analysis on the hydrodynamic
characteristics of a subtropical bay on South of Brazil, the Itapocorói
Bay. The data analyzed was collected by three current profilers
deployed at different areas of the bay, each one with different
degrees of exposure to the most energetic waves, for a 33 days
period. Additionally a one year tide gauge measurement was
analyzed too. Results indicated that the bay can be divided in two
separate environments: a sheltered area being under the influence
of diurnal sea-land breeze and mild currents (under 8cm.s − 1 )
and the exposed area being mainly driven by regional winds,
with a presence of a quite stable coastal current flowing along
the coast towards south and higher velocities (around 20cm.s − 1 ).
Meteorological water level could also be correlated with winds
indicating the presence of local upwelling, with an increase water
level associated with NE winds and a decrease with SE winds. Tidal
analysis indicated that there is a tendency of a water pile up as the
tide wave enters the bay. Residual currents on the bay revealed that
currents are mainly influenced by wind and velocities can reach up
to 2cm.s − 1 wich represents 10% of typical currents on the bay.
